# User Journey Analysis from Registration to Payment (Tableau)

**Goal:** To analyze conversion rates between user registration, trial start, and payment steps.

**Method and Tools:** Built a funnel chart in Tableau, added tooltips to show conversion rates, and used a stacked bar chart to compare registration vs. trial users.

**Result:** The email verification rate was over 74%, showing that users are open to onboarding. However, the biggest drop happened from trial to paid, meaning most users who tried the product didn’t pay. This could be because the product’s value wasn’t clear, or due to pricing or payment problems.

**Skills Gained:** Funnel analysis, measuring conversion, user behavior analytics.
